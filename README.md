# Anomaly_detection
1. Imported All the required libraries like pandas, numpy, pycaret
2. Given multiple text files as data so converted all text file in to single text file and read as pandas dataframe to perform further operations
3. Done Preprocessing and feature selection on data
4. Done train and test split
5. For anomaly detection used pycaret library
6. Performed anomaly detection using isolation forest model on training data
7. Saved trained model for future use
8. Predicted anomaly on testing data using saved model
9. Counted total number of anomaly in train and test data
10. Steps 6,7,8,9 repeated using pycaret clustering model
